# 🔧 InfinityFree File Upload Error Fix

## ❌ **The Error You're Getting**

```
Error during FTP UPLOAD_OPERATION, file not found: "htdocs/assets/css/style.css"
```

## 🎯 **Why This Happens**

This error occurs because:
1. You're trying to upload individual files
2. The folder structure doesn't exist yet
3. InfinityFree's file manager needs the folders to exist first

## ✅ **How to Fix It - Step by Step**

### Method 1: Upload Folders First (Recommended)

1. **Create the Folder Structure**
   - In File Manager, right-click in `htdocs`
   - Select **"New Folder"**
   - Name it `assets`
   - Click **"Create"**

2. **Create Subfolders**
   - Right-click on `assets` folder
   - Select **"New Folder"**
   - Name it `css`
   - Repeat for `js` and `images`

3. **Upload Files to Correct Folders**
   - Navigate to `htdocs/assets/css/`
   - Upload `style.css`
   - Navigate to `htdocs/assets/js/`
   - Upload your JavaScript files
   - Navigate to `htdocs/assets/images/`
   - Upload your image files

### Method 2: Upload Everything at Once (Easier)

1. **Prepare Your Files Locally**
   - Go to `C:\xampp\htdocs\Velvet_vogue_site`
   - Select ALL files and folders
   - Right-click and **"Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"**
   - Name it `velvet_vogue.zip`

2. **Upload the ZIP File**
   - In InfinityFree File Manager, go to `htdocs`
   - Upload `velvet_vogue.zip`
   - Right-click on the ZIP file
   - Select **"Extract"** or **"Unzip"**
   - This will create the proper folder structure

3. **Clean Up**
   - Delete the ZIP file after extraction
   - Verify all folders and files are in place

### Method 3: Use FTP Client (Advanced)

If the above methods don't work:

1. **Download FileZilla** (free FTP client)
2. **Get FTP Credentials** from InfinityFree control panel
3. **Connect via FTP** and upload files directly

## 📁 **Correct Folder Structure**

Your `htdocs` folder should look like this:

```
htdocs/
├── index.php
├── cart.php
├── checkout.php
├── collection.php
├── about.php
├── contact.php
├── login_register.php
├── account.php
├── wishlist.php
├── product.php
├── admin_dashboard.php
├── admin_order_details.php
├── config.php (create this)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── script.js
│   └── images/
│       └── (all your images)
├── uploads/
│   └── products/
│       └── (all your product images)
└── velvet_vogue_database.sql
```

## 🚀 **Quick Fix Steps**

1. **Stop what you're doing**
2. **Delete any partially uploaded files** in `htdocs`
3. **Follow Method 2** (ZIP upload) - it's the easiest
4. **Extract the ZIP file** in `htdocs`
5. **Verify the structure** is correct

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

After uploading, check:

1. **All PHP files** are in `htdocs` root
2. **Assets folder** exists with subfolders
3. **Uploads folder** exists
4. **No error messages** in File Manager

## 🆘 **If You're Still Having Issues**

### Alternative: Manual Folder Creation

1. **Create each folder manually:**
   - `htdocs/assets/`
   - `htdocs/assets/css/`
   - `htdocs/assets/js/`
   - `htdocs/assets/images/`
   - `htdocs/uploads/`
   - `htdocs/uploads/products/`

2. **Upload files to their respective folders**

### Check File Permissions

1. **Right-click on each folder**
2. **Select "Permissions"**
3. **Set to 755** for folders
4. **Set to 644** for files
